# Fake_News_Detection

### Fake News Detection using Semantic Classification

This project aims to detect and classify fake news articles using semantic text analysis and machine learning. By leveraging Word2Vec embeddings and supervised learning models, the system identifies recurring linguistic patterns that help distinguish between genuine and fake news articles.

--------------------
### Objective

. Build a semantic classification model using Word2Vec and supervised learning techniques.
. Classify news articles as either true or fake based on their textual meaning, not just syntax.
